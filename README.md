# Labor-law-website
 A complete website on labor law for a consulting company, includes 27 complete laws, with links to information of interest to workers and employers.  
 The added value was that at the time, 2006, this spanish legal content was not freely available on the net.  
 The web is called "El defensor del trabajador", in spanish.
